//  docs/api.md's /now-playing example is simplified; the deployed shape
//  (confirmed live against radio.kluit.se) nests several fields as objects
//  rather than the doc's flat strings/ints. `context` is richer still (time
//  of day, weather, festival, clock — all objects, not the doc's plain
//  strings) and unused by this app's UI, so it's deliberately left
//  unmodeled rather than half-guessed; Codable ignores JSON keys with no
//  matching property.
